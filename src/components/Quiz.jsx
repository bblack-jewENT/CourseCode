              too complicated! So Tim simplified it into a "markup language" -
              basically adding special tags around text to give it structure and

              but every single piece of styling had to be done with HTML tags.
              Want a red text? You'd use <code>&lt;font color="red"&gt;</code>.

              In the early web, services were siloed. Salesforce pioneered the
              idea of exposing business logic through APIs. Suddenly, developers
              could integrate external services into their applications!
